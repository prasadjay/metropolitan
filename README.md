Metropolitan Engineering Project System
=======================================================

Java and MySql based software system for Metropolitan Engineering Ltd. 
This was a 8 member group project and these codes are JUST my parts in that system which 
were Product management and Project Handling System. 

PS - Mysql queries are also included inside the project folder. You may want to change the connection string.
And this is not the complete system. Just my parts of whole work.
